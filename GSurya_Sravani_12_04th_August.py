# List of elements'''

1) What  is  the  output  if  15  is  seacrhed ?  --->  Found  at  index  2

4) What  action  to  be  made  when  'x'  matches   with  list  element ?  --->
																				Print  found   message  along  with  index  and

5) What  action  to  be  made  when  'x'   does  not  match  with  all  the  elements  of  list ?  --->
